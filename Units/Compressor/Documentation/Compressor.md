Hydrogen creation demands 180 kJ/mol H₂ from the PEM Hydrogen Generator.
To convert energy from kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg) to kilowatt-hours per kilogram (kWh/kg), you should divide by 3.6:
Energy Value in kWh/kg = 90,000 kJ/kg / 3.6 kJ/kWh = 25 kWh/kg
180 kJ / 1 mol H₂
1 g / 0.49603174603174605 mol H₂
89.28571428571429 kJ/g
89285.71428571429 kJ/kg
24.801587301587304 kWh/kg

The amount of Hydrogen produced by the Generator is:
24.801587301587304 kWh/kg

947.52 ton H₂ per year or 2.60 ton H₂ per day. If we only produce Hydrogen all year long.

From the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, the internal work wi needed for the compression of a gas can be calculated from the enthalpies h1 and h2 before and after the compression and the cooling energy qK:
$w_{i}=h_{2}-h_{1}+q_{K}$
The minimum required ideal compression work is the work for isothermal compression wis, where the temperature stays constant during compression through cooling. The ideal isothermal compression work wis can be found using the T–s-diagram. In the absence of internal friction, the cooling energy qK equals the reversible heat and can be visualized in the T–s-diagram as the area below the change of states, see Figure 1.4a. The value can be calculated from
$q_{\mathrm{K}}=T\cdot\Delta s$
For a compression from 1 bar to 900 bar at ambient temperature one ﬁnds the
following value for equilibrium hydrogen: wis=4383-3787+8181=8777 kJ kg¯¹.
This means that the compression needs an energy input of about 7.5% of the
caloriﬁc value of hydrogen. Taking into account the efﬁciency of compressors at
around 50%, one ﬁnds that the energy needed for the compression of hydrogen to
900 bar increases to about 15% of its caloriﬁc value. An overview of densities and
energy densities at pressures relevant for containers is given in Tables 1.2 and 1.3, a
comparison of densities and compressor work with liquid storage is given in
Figure 1.22 (see later).
Substituting the deﬁnition of the reversible heat
$q_{rev}=$q_{A}+$q_{R}=dh-vdp
in Eq. (1.16), we get, for compression without considering friction
$w_{i}=\int_{1}^{2}vdp$
With the simpliﬁcation of hydrogen as an ideal gas, we can substitute v from the ideal
gas Eq. (1.4) and get:
$w_{i}=R T\int_{1}^{2}\frac{dp}{p} = R T\ln\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}$
In our case, the calculation gives wi=8220 kJ kg¯¹. In comparison with the work
calculated above this is 6.2% less, which is because hydrogen deviates from ideal gas
behavior in the pressure range under consideration.
With ﬂowing gases, compression is generally linked with a temperature increase,
while expansion leads to a decrease in temperature. During the ﬁlling of a pressure
vessel, gas ﬂows from a reservoir of even higher pressure into the tank. Thermo-
dynamically the process can be approximated by an adiabatic ﬂow through a
restriction where the total enthalpy remains constant. The associated change in
temperature is described by the Joule–Thomson coefﬁcient. In the relevant range of
pressures, hydrogen has a negative Joule–Thomson coefﬁcient, which means the
temperature increases with a pressure decrease. The expansion of hydrogen from
1000 bar to 13 bar produces a rise in temperature of about 50 K.
The compression of the gas in the tank to be ﬁlled also causes its temperature to
rise. This effect even outweighs the Joule–Thomson effect. A simulation can be done
based on the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. Regarding the reservoir and the tank as a
closed adiabatic system, the internal energies of the two containers before and after
the ﬁlling process are equal. Regarding the tank to be ﬁlled alone as an open adiabatic
system, the enthalpy ﬂow into the tank equals its increase in internal energy.
The temperature of the gas in the tank will increase considerably during the ﬁlling
process causing the container to warm up. As the ﬁlled container cools to ambient
temperature, the pressure of the gas will decrease accordingly, thus leaving
the container at ambient temperature below nominal ﬁlling pressure. This loss of
ﬁlling mass can be avoided by a so-called cold-ﬁll device, where the hydrogen is
cooled during the ﬁlling process in a heat exchanger, for example, with liquid
nitrogen.
