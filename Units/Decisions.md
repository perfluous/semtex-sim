Supply: 23,5 GWh / year production from solar farm.
Demand: 5200 houses taking for 14,82 GWh / year.
> 8000 houses take ~22,8 GWh / year. Taking 65% efficiency for system making a total of 5200 viable.

Problem:
> At peak we create ~77GWh. However, this energy supply is too high to be economically viable.
The average energy supply is 1.64 MW.

Possible solution:
> We will require some batteries to take on the high load, and we will require a system that can actively supply this energy to the generator and to the customer when required.

Check cost of Battery vs discharge time towards Generator.
10MW energy
8,5MW exergy
Calc nighttime discharge towards Generator.

Battery & Compressor

As calculated in /SimulationData/notes.md: We have a huge surplus of energy. 
So much that the capacity for Hydrogen generation is overstept.
Hence, we shall go forward with the minimum requirement of 5.2 GJ yearly and scale up from there.

We will now proceed to calculate the size of the Gerator and Batteries.
This will be calculated as:
Hours of positive energy generation 
Calculate minimum required capacity during maximum energy generation periods.

> The battery can store 3 days of maximum energy deficit.
> This is around 4.32 MWh
> We will be using Lithium-Ion batteries for our model.


> The compressor shall be an Ionic Liquid Compressor.
> 700 to 1000 bar possible. After compression, hydrogen is cooled -40 ⁰C which is used to enable refuling in less than 3 minutes.

> Epsilon chosen to be 0.8 like in the study.
