The ionic liquid compressor is an effective method for compressing hydrogen because of the inherent advantages of the ionic liquid, for instance, the extremely low vapour pressure [39], the excellent lubricity feature [40], inert features in thermal [41] and chemical [42] reactions, and nonflammability [43]. It is worth noting that the ionic liquid compressor is applied for the onsite compression and storage of hydrogen in the hydrogen refuelling stations, which is not designed for long-distance transporting. Additionally, a complex gas-liquid interaction in the compression chamber would occur due to the existence of the ionic liquid in the cylinder. During the suction and discharge procedure, the fluid field near the inlet and outlet orifices would influence the internal flow field in the compression chamber, which further impacts the free face of the bulk liquid. When the interface shape changes, it may generate droplets in the gas space or entrainment gas in the bulk liquid.
